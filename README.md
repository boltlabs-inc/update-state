This repository contains a prototype implementation of the Update State function from the Bolt protocol, implemented for Bitcoin.

## Install

This depends on the Bolt Labs version of the `emp-toolkit` framework.
You'll need to build and install [emp-tool](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/emp-tool) and [emp-ot](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/emp-ot).
You will also need the [emp-sh2pc](https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-sh2pc) library. This repo is only compatible with an older version of the framework:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-sh2pc.git
$ cd emp-sh2pc
$ git checkout 09c276b55ce7c2c7f27f54de49c38e5a39abbd9c
```
Then you can build and install as usual.
